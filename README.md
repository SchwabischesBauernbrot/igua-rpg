# IguaRPG ![Iguana character](./iguana.svg)
### A computer game of the ages
This is a fangame of [Oddwarg Animal RPG](http://oddwarg.com/index.php?id=OARPG), a Game Maker game from 2003.

At this point, the game is maybe 42.5% finished.

[You can play the current build here.](https://igua-rpg.herokuapp.com/)

## Using the source code
This is a modern web project. You will need `node` and `npm` to continue.

You will need the Git LFS extension to correctly pull the project's FLAC and WAV files.

You will need [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to run and build the project. You will need a plugin to encode / decode mp3. On my Mac I installed sox using brew and it seemed to include this. On Windows you will need to copy some DLLs to your sox installation folder.
