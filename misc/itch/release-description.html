			<p>This is a game based on <strong>Oddwarg Animal RPG</strong>, a 2003 Game Maker game by my longtime friend and mentor. I played it extensively as a child, and it fueled my curiosity for programming.</p>
			<p>Nowadays, I find there is a sweetness about its naivete and unique understanding of what an RPG is. With this project, I am exploring my nostalgia for the original game (and its unreleased sequel).</p>

			<h2>Soundtrack</h2>
			<p>The game's 44 original songs were composed by me. On many of the songs, you will hear the influence of composers like <strong>Gary&nbsp;Wilson</strong>, <strong>the&nbsp;Oddwarg</strong>, and <strong>The&nbsp;Residents</strong>.</p>
			<p>All of the instruments were played by me, typically on a cheap MIDI keyboard, and recorded in realtime.</p>

			<h2>Source Code</h2>
			<p>If you are a freak and/or geek you might be interested in looking at the source code of the game.</p>
			<p>It was written in <strong>TypeScript</strong> and uses a heavily modified version of the <strong>PixiJS</strong> rendering engine.</p>
			<p>Some of my favorite technical accomplishments include: strongly-typed level files, enemy attack patterns written using async/await, and cutscenes written using async/await.</p>
