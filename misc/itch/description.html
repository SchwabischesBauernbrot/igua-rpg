<h3>About</h3>
<p>
This is a game based on <a href="http://oddwarg.com/index.php?id=OARPG">Oddwarg Animal RPG</a>, a 2003 Game Maker game by my longtime friend and mentor. I played it extensively as a child, and it fueled my curiosity for programming. Nowadays, I find there is a sweetness about its naivete and unique understanding of what an RPG is. With this project, I am exploring my nostalgia for the original game (and its unreleased sequel). Another major, although not totally transparent, goal for this project is to create development tools that meet my high standards.

Currently, I have only created the first "chapter" of the game. In the future, there will be at least four chapters, and I will likely sell the game for a few dollars. I don't want to work stupid jobs anymore. I don't expect to live off of the work that I enjoy, but this could be a start.
